## Fitting equation of Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution of K.E for a single frame at a certain T (equivalent to velocity)
## Used to correlate atomic vels (in a frame) with T or
## in random assignment of vels to atoms acc to a given T

# x = K.E of atom
# y = f(K.E) -> probabilty of finding an atom with this K.E, or fractional population 
# a0: KbT (thermal energy, in units of energy)

y = (2 / sqrt(Pi * (a0 ^ 3))) * sqrt(x) * exp(-x / a0)
